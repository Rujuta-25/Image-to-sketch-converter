# Image to Sketch Converter with Various Filters

This is a data science project that focuses on creating a Python-based image to sketch converter using various filters. This project leverages popular libraries like OpenCV and NumPy to transform digital images into artistic sketches. By applying a variety of filters and techniques, you can produce different styles of sketches from input images.

## Project Overview

The Image to Sketch Converter project is designed to accomplish the following goals:

1. **Convert Color Images to Sketches**: Transform colored images into grayscale sketches.
2. **Apply Various Filters**: Implement different filters and techniques to achieve diverse sketch styles, including edge detection, pencil sketch, and more.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create a simple command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with and convert their images.
4. **Customization**: Allow users to customize the filter parameters to fine-tune the output sketches.
5. **Export Options**: Enable users to save the generated sketches in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
  - **src**: The source code for the project.
  - **image_to_sketch_coverter.ipynb**: Contains the main code for image conversion using various filters.
  - **README.md**: The file you are currently reading. It provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
